# Markdown to HTML/ANSI converter

The Markdown to HTML/ANSI Converter is a command-line tool that  converts Markdown documents into HTML or ANSI format. It simplifies the process of formatting text by automatically translating Markdown syntax into corresponding HTML or ANSI markup.

## Functionality

The application takes a Markdown file as input and generates HTML/ANSI output. It supports basic Markdown syntax for formatting text, including:

- **Bold**: Enclosed with double asterisks (\*\*bold text\*\*)
- **Italic**: Enclosed with underscores (\_italic text\_)
- **Monospaced**: Enclosed with backticks (\`monospaced text\`)
- **Preformatted Text**: Enclosed with triple backticks (\`\`\`preformatted text\`\`\`)
- **Paragraphs**: Separated by a blank line or two consecutive newline characters

## Usage

### Building and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd lab1-md-converter
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    node program.js <markdown_file_path> [--out <output_file_path>] [--format=<ansi_or_html>]
    ```

**Run tests:**
    ```
    npm test
    ```
## User Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
5. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can use the program to convert Markdown files to HTML/ANSI.
7. Run the program by executing `node program.js <markdown_file_path> [--out <output_file_path>] [--format=<ansi_or_html>]`.
8. If successful, the HTML/ANSI output will be displayed in the terminal or saved to the specified output file. If any errors occur during conversion, appropriate error messages will be shown.

_!Note that if you don't specify the format of the output, you will receive ANSI in the command line and HTML in your document._

## Conclusion

It was my first time writing test code, and now I have a better understanding of what testing is really like. I realized that while it may be difficult to create a good set of tests at the moment, this hard work pays off in the future. 

Iâ€™ve never worked with GitHub Actions either. The fact that code can be run automatically by a computer for every commit has really impressed me. 
However, it seems like the importance of tests would be more apparent in programs that you work on for a long time and with other people. Since the converter is a relatively small project, I think it would be possible to make do with testing the program by hand.      

So, while it might not be 100% necessary for every case, I can definitely see the value of tests, especially as projects grow.
